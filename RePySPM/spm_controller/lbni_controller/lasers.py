class Lasers:
    """
    A class to control and manage the lasers in a scanning system.

    This class provides methods to initialize, set, and retrieve parameters for the lasers,
    including the readout power, excitation power, and excitation offset. It also controls
    the laser states (on/off) and allows dynamic adjustment of these values.

    Methods:
        get_laser_parameters: Retrieves the current laser parameters from the system.
        set_laser_parameters: Sets laser parameters such as power and state.
        get_readout_mW: Retrieves the power of the readout laser in milliwatts.
        set_readout_mW: Sets the power of the readout laser in milliwatts.
        get_excitation_mW: Retrieves the power of the excitation laser in milliwatts.
        set_excitation_mW: Sets the power of the excitation laser in milliwatts.
        get_excitation_offset: Retrieves the offset of the excitation laser.
        set_excitation_offset: Sets the offset of the excitation laser.
        get_readout_ON: Retrieves the state of the readout laser (on/off).
        set_readout_ON: Sets the state of the readout laser (on/off).
        get_excitation_ON: Retrieves the state of the excitation laser (on/off).
        set_excitation_ON: Sets the state of the excitation laser (on/off).
